When considering a place to book an Airbnb, it's important to consider many of the qualities
that make each neighborhood a good place to live, with some exceptions. Generally, because airbnb's
usually indicate a short stay in a specific neighborhood, most of the qualities which make a
Neighborhood desirable in the long-term can be ignored (good schools, good doctors, best for retirees).
On the other hand, there's an emphasis on benefits that can be appreciated in the short-term, such as
safety and accessibility to local attractions. One feature which is more complicated is the cost of living,
because, while price is important, we must still consider the demand for luxury visits, which are more
desirable in a short-term destination (which Airbnb specializes in) than an actual living situation.
